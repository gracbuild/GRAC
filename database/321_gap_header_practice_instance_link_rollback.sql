-- 321 rollback -- restore sp_custom_gap_header to its exact pre-321
-- body (250's own text). Removes PracticeInstanceId/Code/Name from the
-- projection; the gap-detail Practice Instance tab (client-side) simply
-- stops finding a practiceInstanceId and stays hidden, same as it does
-- today for any gap with no linked instance.
